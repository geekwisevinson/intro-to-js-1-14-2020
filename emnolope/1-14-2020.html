 JAVASCRIPT

You learn a little each day and after a while it's quite substantial.

This is a VERY student oriented course.

get JS into HTML?
<script src="YOUR URL HERE"></script>
<script></script>

Every program is made of PROCESS/EXECUTION and DATA/MEMORY
JS will forget everything after it's done.

//I'm a comment!
/* I'm a comment too!*/

VARIABLES:
    variable can't start with a number, and a certain list of characters
    >>const<<
    Use const for everything unless you can't do it with const
    >>let<< regular variable, limited scope
    >>var<< forbidden magics, global variable

DATA TYPES:
    let mystr1='string';
    let mystr2="string";
    let mystr3=`Hey, ${Noun} you're a ${Adjective} gimme you digits`;
    let mynum1=10.3;
    let mybol1=true
    "Every primitive has a truthy falsey"
    !! <-- Operator to turn into truthy falsy (un negative)
        "" false
        0 false
        false false
    === are they EXACTLY the same?
    == are they the same?
    !== not are they EXACTLY the same?
    != not are they the same?
variable names should make sense
CONDITIONALS
    let age = 20;
    a if a < b else b 
FUNCTIONS
    functions
EVENTS
    click
    event
    hover
    document.body.addEventListener('click', function() {alert("MATE")})
// << Comments
/* */
You can do three things in JS, assignments, loops, conditionals
